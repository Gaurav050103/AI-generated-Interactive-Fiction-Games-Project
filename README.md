Echoes of the Void
A short, interactive fiction game built as a college project, designed to showcase key concepts in web development and narrative design. The game combines a simple, text-based narrative with interactive elements like an inventory system and dynamic visuals to create an immersive experience.

The project's goal was to explore how classic text adventure mechanics could be enhanced using modern front-end technologies. By integrating an inventory, conditional choices, and dynamic background changes, the game demonstrates a clear progression in complexity, moving beyond a simple "Choose Your Own Adventure" story to a more robust, logic-driven narrative experience.

Key Features

Branching Narrative: The story unfolds based on the choices you make, leading to multiple distinct endings.

Inventory System: Collect and use items to solve puzzles and unlock new story paths.

Conditional Choices: Some choices will only appear if you have the right item in your inventory, adding a layer of depth to the gameplay.

Dynamic Backgrounds: The background changes with each new scene to match your location, enhancing the game's atmosphere.

Getting Started

This project is built using a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript structure. To run the game, you'll need all three files in the same folder.

Download the Files: Make sure you have the following three files saved in the same directory:

index.html (The main game structure)

style.css (The visual styling and backgrounds)

game.js (All the game's logic and story content)

Open in a Browser: Simply double-click the index.html file. It will open in your default web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge), and the game will begin.

How to Play

The game is simple to play:

Read the text that appears on the screen to understand your current situation.

Click one of the available buttons to make a choice.

Keep an eye on your inventory, as finding new items will open up new options later in the game.

Have fun exploring the void!
